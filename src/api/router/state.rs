	// SAFETY: We replaced Arc<Services> with *const Services in State. This is
	// worth about 10 clones (20 reference count updates) for each request handled.
	// Though this is not an incredibly large quantity, it's woefully unnecessary
	// given the context as explained below; though it is not currently known to be
	// a performance bottleneck, the front-line position justifies preempting it.
	//
	// Services is created prior to the axum/tower stack and Router, and prior
	// to serving any requests through the handlers in this crate. It is then
	// dropped only after all requests have completed, the listening sockets
	// have been closed, axum/tower has been dropped. Thus Services is
	// expected to live at least as long as any instance of State, making the
	// constant updates to the prior Arc unnecessary to keep Services alive.
	//
	// Nevertheless if it is possible to accomplish this by annotating State
	// with a lifetime to hold a reference (and be aware I have made a
	// significant effort trying to make this work) this unsafety may not be
	// necessary. It is either very difficult or impossible to get a
	// lifetime'ed reference through Router / RumaHandler; though it is
	// possible to pass a reference through axum's `with_state()` in trivial
	// configurations as the only requirement of a State is Clone.
