#### What is Matrix?

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges (also called Matrix Appservices)
to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord.

#### What is the goal?

A high-performance and efficient Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and
just works. You can install it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to
host Matrix for your family, friends or company.

#### Can I try it out?

An official conduwuit server ran by me is available at transfem.dev
([element.transfem.dev](https://element.transfem.dev) /
[cinny.transfem.dev](https://cinny.transfem.dev))

transfem.dev is a public homeserver that can be used, it is not a "test only
homeserver". This means there are rules, so please read the rules:
[https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt](https://transfem.dev/homeserver_rules.txt)

transfem.dev is also listed at
[servers.joinmatrix.org](https://servers.joinmatrix.org/)

#### What is the current status?

conduwuit is technically a hard fork of Conduit, which is in Beta. The Beta status
initially was inherited from Conduit, however overtime this Beta status is rapidly
becoming less and less relevant as our codebase significantly diverges more and more.

conduwuit is quite stable and very usable as a daily driver and for a low-medium
sized homeserver. There is still a lot of more work to be done, but it is in a far
better place than the project was in early 2024.

#### How is conduwuit funded? Is conduwuit sustainable?

conduwuit has no external funding. This is made possible purely in my freetime with
contributors, also in their free time, and only by user-curated donations.

conduwuit has existed since around November 2023, but [only became more publicly known
in March/April 2024](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/04/26/this-week-in-matrix-2024-04-26/#conduwuit-website)
and we have no plans in stopping or slowing down any time soon!

#### Can I migrate or switch from Conduit?

conduwuit is a complete drop-in replacement for Conduit. As long as you are using RocksDB,
the only "migration" you need to do is replace the binary or container image. There
is no harm or additional steps required for using conduwuit.

#### Is it conduwuit or Conduwuit?

Both, but I prefer conduwuit.
