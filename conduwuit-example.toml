# =============================================================================
#  This is the official example config for conduwuit.
#  If you use it for your server, you will need to adjust it to your own needs.
#  At the very least, change the server_name field!
#
#  This documentation can also be found at https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay/configuration.html
# =============================================================================

[global]

# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, conduit.rs

# The Conduit server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests (delegation). See
# https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixclient
# and
# https://spec.matrix.org/v1.9/server-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixserver
# for more information

# YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS
#server_name = "your.server.name"

# Servers listed here will be used to gather public keys of other servers (notary trusted key servers).
#
# The default behaviour for conduwuit is to attempt to query trusted key servers before querying the individual servers.
# This is done for performance reasons, but if you would like to query individual servers before the notary servers
# configured below, set to
#
# (Currently, conduwuit doesn't support batched key requests, so this list should only contain Synapse servers)
# Defaults to `matrix.org`
# trusted_servers = ["matrix.org"]

# Sentry.io crash/panic reporting, performance monitoring/metrics, etc.
# Conduwuit's Sentry reporting endpoint is o4506996327251968.ingest.us.sentry.io
#
# Defaults to false
#sentry = false

# Report your Conduwuit server_name in Sentry.io crash reports and metrics
#
# Defaults to false
#sentry_send_server_name = false

# Performance monitoring/tracing sample rate for Sentry.io
#
# Note that too high values may impact performance, and can be disabled by setting it to 0.0
#
# Defaults to 0.15
#sentry_traces_sample_rate = 0.15


### Database configuration

# This is the only directory where conduwuit will save its data, including media
database_path = "/var/lib/matrix-conduit/"

# Database backend: Only rocksdb and sqlite are supported. Please note that sqlite
# will perform significantly worse than rocksdb as it is not intended to be used the
# way it is by conduwuit. sqlite only exists for historical reasons.
database_backend = "rocksdb"


### Network

# The port(s) conduwuit will be running on. You need to set up a reverse proxy such as
# Caddy or Nginx so all requests to /_matrix on port 443 and 8448 will be
# forwarded to the conduwuit instance running on this port
# Docker users: Don't change this, you'll need to map an external port to this.
# To listen on multiple ports, specify a vector e.g. [8080, 8448]
port = 6167

# default address (IPv4 or IPv6) conduwuit will listen on. Generally you want this to be
# localhost (127.0.0.1 / ::1). If you are using Docker or a container NAT networking setup, you
# likely need this to be 0.0.0.0.
address = "127.0.0.1"

# How many requests conduwuit sends to other servers at the same time concurrently. Default is 500
# Note that because conduwuit is very fast unlike other homeserver implementations, setting this too
# high could inadvertently result in ratelimits kicking in, or overloading lower-end homeservers out there.
#
# A valid use-case for enabling this is if you have a significant amount of overall federation activity
# such as many rooms joined/tracked, and many servers in the true destination cache caused by that. Upon
# rebooting conduwuit, depending on how fast your resources are, client and incoming federation requests
# may timeout or be "stalled" for a period of time due to hitting the max concurrent requests limit from
# refreshing federation/destination caches and such.
#
# If you have a lot of active users on your homeserver, you will definitely need to raise this.
#
# No this will not speed up room joins.
#max_concurrent_requests = 500

# Max request size for file uploads
max_request_size = 20_000_000 # in bytes

# Uncomment unix_socket_path to listen on a UNIX socket at the specified path.
# If listening on a UNIX socket, you must remove/comment the 'address' key if defined and add your
# reverse proxy to the 'conduwuit' group, unless world RW permissions are specified with unix_socket_perms (666 minimum).

# max log level for conduwuit. allows debug, info, warn, or error
# see also: https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives

# controls whether encrypted rooms and events are allowed (default true)
#allow_encryption = false

# if enabled, conduwuit will send a simple GET request periodically to `https://pupbrain.dev/check-for-updates/stable`
# for any new announcements made. Despite the name, this is not an update check
# endpoint, it is simply an announcement check endpoint.
# Defaults to false.
#allow_check_for_updates = false

# Set to false to disable users from joining or creating room versions that aren't 100% officially supported by conduwuit.
# conduwuit officially supports room versions 6 - 10. conduwuit has experimental/unstable support for 3 - 5, and 11.
# Defaults to true.
#allow_unstable_room_versions = true

# Option to control adding arbitrary text to the end of the user's displayname upon registration with a space before the text.
# This was the lightning bolt emoji option, just replaced with support for adding your own custom text or emojis.
# To disable, set this to "" (an empty string)
# Defaults to "🏳️‍⚧️" (trans pride flag)
#new_user_displayname_suffix = "🏳️‍⚧️"

# Option to control whether conduwuit will query your list of trusted notary key servers (`trusted_servers`) for
# remote homeserver signing keys it doesn't know *first*, or query the individual servers first before falling back to the trusted
# key servers.
#
# The former/default behaviour makes federated/remote rooms joins generally faster because we're querying a single (or list of) server
# that we know works, is reasonably fast, and is reliable for just about all the homeserver signing keys in the room. Querying individual
# servers may take longer depending on the general infrastructure of everyone in there, how many dead servers there are, etc.
#
# However, this does create an increased reliance on one single or multiple large entities as `trusted_servers` should generally
# contain long-term and large servers who know a very large number of homeservers.
#
# If you don't know what any of this means, leave this and `trusted_servers` alone to their defaults.
#
# Defaults to true as this is the fastest option for federation.

### Generic database options

# Set this to any float value to multiply conduwuit's in-memory LRU caches with.
# May be useful if you have significant memory to spare to increase performance.
# Defaults to 1.0.
#conduit_cache_capacity_modifier = 1.0

# Set this to any float value in megabytes for conduwuit to tell the database engine that this much memory is available for database-related caches.
# May be useful if you have significant memory to spare to increase performance.

# Interval in seconds when conduwuit will run database cleanup operations.
#
# For SQLite: this will flush the WAL by executing `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(RESTART)` (https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_wal_checkpoint)
# For RocksDB: this will run `flush_opt` to flush database memtables to SST files on disk (https://docs.rs/rocksdb/latest/rocksdb/struct.DBCommon.html#method.flush_opt)
# These operations always run on shutdown.
#
# Defaults to 30 minutes (1800 seconds) to avoid IO amplification from too frequent cleanups
#cleanup_second_interval = 1800


### RocksDB options

# Set this to true to use RocksDB config options that are tailored to HDDs (slower device storage)
#
# It is worth noting that by default, conduwuit will use RocksDB with Direct IO enabled. *Generally* speaking this improves performance as it bypasses buffered I/O (system page cache).
# However there is a potential chance that Direct IO may cause issues with database operations if your setup is uncommon. This has been observed with FUSE filesystems, and possibly ZFS filesystem.
# RocksDB generally deals/corrects these issues but it cannot account for all setups.
# If you experience any weird RocksDB issues, try enabling this option as it turns off Direct IO and feel free to report in the conduwuit Matrix room if this option fixes your DB issues.
# See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Direct-IO for more information.
#
# Defaults to false
#rocksdb_optimize_for_spinning_disks = false

# RocksDB log level. This is not the same as conduwuit's log level. This is the log level for the RocksDB engine/library
# which show up in your database folder/path as `LOG` files. Defaults to error. conduwuit will typically log RocksDB errors as normal.
#rocksdb_log_level = "error"

# Max RocksDB `LOG` file size before rotating in bytes. Defaults to 4MB.
#rocksdb_max_log_file_size = 4194304

# Time in seconds before RocksDB will forcibly rotate logs. Defaults to 0.
#rocksdb_log_time_to_roll = 0

# Amount of threads that RocksDB will use for parallelism on database operatons such as cleanup, sync, flush, compaction, etc. Set to 0 to use all your physical cores.
#
# Defaults to your CPU physical core count (not logical threads).
#rocksdb_parallelism_threads = 0

# Maximum number of LOG files RocksDB will keep. This must *not* be set to 0. It must be at least 1.
# Defaults to 3 as these are not very useful.
#rocksdb_max_log_files = 3

# Type of RocksDB database compression to use.
# Available options are "zstd", "zlib", "bz2" and "lz4"
# It is best to use ZSTD as an overall good balance between speed/performance, storage, IO amplification, and CPU usage.
# For more performance but less compression (more storage used) and less CPU usage, use LZ4.
# See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compression for more details.
#
# Defaults to "zstd"
#rocksdb_compression_algo = "zstd"

# Level of compression the specified compression algorithm for RocksDB to use.
# Default is 32767, which is internally read by RocksDB as the default magic number and
# translated to the library's default compression level as they all differ.
# See their `kDefaultCompressionLevel`.
#
#rocksdb_compression_level = 32767

# Level of compression the specified compression algorithm for the bottommost level/data for RocksDB to use.
# Default is 32767, which is internally read by RocksDB as the default magic number and
# translated to the library's default compression level as they all differ.
# See their `kDefaultCompressionLevel`.
#
# Since this is the bottommost level (generally old and least used data), it may be desirable to have a very
# high compression level here as it's lesss likely for this data to be used. Research your chosen compression algorithm.
#
#rocksdb_bottommost_compression_level = 32767

# Whether to enable RocksDB "bottommost_compression".
# At the expense of more CPU usage, this will further compress the database to reduce more storage.
# It is recommended to use ZSTD compression with this for best compression results.
# See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compression for more details.
#
# Defaults to false as this uses more CPU when compressing.
#rocksdb_bottommost_compression = false

# Database recovery mode (for RocksDB WAL corruption)
#
# Use this option when the server reports corruption and refuses to start. Set mode 2 (PointInTime)
# to cleanly recover from this corruption. The server will continue from the last good state,
# several seconds or minutes prior to the crash. Clients may have to run "clear-cache & reload" to
# account for the rollback. Upon success, you may reset the mode back to default and restart again.
# Please note in some cases the corruption error may not be cleared for at least 30 minutes of
# operation in PointInTime mode.
#
# As a very last ditch effort, if PointInTime does not fix or resolve anything, you can try mode
# 3 (SkipAnyCorruptedRecord) but this will leave the server in a potentially inconsistent state.
#
# The default mode 1 (TolerateCorruptedTailRecords) will automatically drop the last entry in the
# database if corrupted during shutdown, but nothing more. It is extraordinarily unlikely this will
# desynchronize clients. To disable any form of silent rollback set mode 0 (AbsoluteConsistency).
#
# The options are:
# 0 = AbsoluteConsistency
# 1 = TolerateCorruptedTailRecords (default)
# 2 = PointInTime (use me if trying to recover)
# 3 = SkipAnyCorruptedRecord (you now voided your Conduwuit warranty)
#
# See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/WAL-Recovery-Modes for more information
#
# Defaults to 1 (TolerateCorruptedTailRecords)
#rocksdb_recovery_mode = 1

# even when they are not full. Setting this will increase load on the storage backplane and is never advised
# under normal circumstances.

### Domain Name Resolution and Caching

# Maximum entries stored in DNS memory-cache. The size of an entry may vary so please take care if

# Minimum time-to-live in seconds for NXDOMAIN entries in the DNS cache. This value is critical for
# the server to federate efficiently. NXDOMAIN's are assumed to not be returning to the federation
# and aggressively cached rather than constantly rechecked.
#dns_min_ttl_nxdomain = 60 * 60 * 24 * 3

### Request Timeouts, Connection Timeouts, and Connection Pooling

## Request Timeouts are HTTP response timeouts
## Connection Timeouts are TCP connection timeouts
##
## Connection Pooling Timeouts are timeouts for keeping an open idle connection alive.
## Connection pooling and keepalive is very useful for federation or other places where for performance reasons,
## we want to keep connections open that we will re-use frequently due to TCP and TLS 1.3 overhead/expensiveness.
